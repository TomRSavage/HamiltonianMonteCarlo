# Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Sampling in Python
## With automatic differentiation and plotting abilities

An implementation of HMC sampling in Python with plotting abilities.
For an explanation of the work see [https://tom-savage.co.uk/Hamiltonian-Monte-Carlo](https://tom-savage.co.uk/Hamiltonian-Monte-Carlo).

IMPORTANT NOTE: At the moment the code is uncommented but hopefully I will get round to commenting it at some point.
